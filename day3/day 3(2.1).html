<h1> ICE CREAM </h1>
<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_dessert">frozen dessert</a> typically made from <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream">milk or cream</a> that has been flavoured with a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetener">sweetener</a>, either sugar or an alternative, and a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice">spice</a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean">cocoa</a> or vanilla, or with fruit, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry">strawberries</a> or peaches.
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_coloring">Food colouring</a> is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is  cooled below the <a href="https://www.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_coloring">freezing point of water</a> and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. 
     It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> together.
     The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature">temperatures</a> (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>
